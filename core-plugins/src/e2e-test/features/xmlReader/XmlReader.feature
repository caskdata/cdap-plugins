@XmlReader_Source
Feature:File Sink - Verification of XmlReader plugin to File successful data transfer

  @XmlReader_Source_Required @XMLREADER_TEST @FILE_SINK_TEST
  Scenario: To verify data is getting transferred from XmlReader to File sink
    Given Open Datafusion Project to configure pipeline
    When Select plugin: "XML Reader" from the plugins list as: "Source"
    When Expand Plugin group in the LHS plugins list: "Sink"
    When Select plugin: "File" from the plugins list as: "Sink"
    Then Connect plugins: "XMLReader" and "File" to establish connection
    Then Navigate to the properties page of plugin: "XMLReader"
    Then Enter input plugin property: "referenceName" with value: "ReferenceName"
    Then Enter input plugin property: "path" with value: "xmlTestFile"
    Then Enter input plugin property: "nodePath" with value: "node"
    Then Select dropdown plugin property: "reprocessingRequired" with option value: "No"
    Then Validate "XMLReader" plugin properties
    Then Close the Plugin Properties page
    Then Navigate to the properties page of plugin: "File"
    Then Enter input plugin property: "referenceName" with value: "FileReferenceName"
    Then Enter input plugin property: "path" with value: "fileSinkTargetBucket"
    Then Replace input plugin property: "pathSuffix" with value: "yyyy-MM-dd-HH-mm"
    Then Select dropdown plugin property: "format" with option value: "csv"
    Then Validate "File" plugin properties
    Then Close the Plugin Properties page
    Then Save the pipeline
    Then Deploy the pipeline
    Then Run the Pipeline in Runtime
    Then Wait till pipeline is in running state
    Then Open and capture logs
    Then Verify the pipeline status is "Succeeded"
    Then Close the pipeline logs
    Then Validate OUT record count is equal to IN record count
    Then Validate output file generated by xmlReader and file sink plugin "fileSinkTargetBucket" is equal to expected output file "outputForXMLTest"

  @XmlReader_Source_Required @XMLREADER_DELETE_TEST @FILE_SINK_TEST
  Scenario: To verify data is getting transferred from XmlReader to File sink using pattern and delete action
    Given Open Datafusion Project to configure pipeline
    When Select plugin: "XML Reader" from the plugins list as: "Source"
    When Expand Plugin group in the LHS plugins list: "Sink"
    When Select plugin: "File" from the plugins list as: "Sink"
    Then Connect plugins: "XMLReader" and "File" to establish connection
    Then Navigate to the properties page of plugin: "XMLReader"
    Then Enter input plugin property: "referenceName" with value: "ReferenceName"
    Then Enter input plugin property: "path" with value: "xmlTestFile"
    Then Enter input plugin property: "nodePath" with value: "node"
    Then Select dropdown plugin property: "reprocessingRequired" with option value: "No"
    Then Enter input plugin property: "pattern" with value: "filePattern"
    Then Select dropdown plugin property: "ActionAfterProcessingFile" with option value: "Delete"
    Then Validate "XMLReader" plugin properties
    Then Close the Plugin Properties page
    Then Navigate to the properties page of plugin: "File"
    Then Enter input plugin property: "referenceName" with value: "FileReferenceName"
    Then Enter input plugin property: "path" with value: "fileSinkTargetBucket"
    Then Replace input plugin property: "pathSuffix" with value: "yyyy-MM-dd-HH-mm"
    Then Select dropdown plugin property: "format" with option value: "csv"
    Then Validate "File" plugin properties
    Then Close the Plugin Properties page
    Then Save the pipeline
    Then Deploy the pipeline
    Then Run the Pipeline in Runtime
    Then Wait till pipeline is in running state
    Then Open and capture logs
    Then Verify the pipeline status is "Succeeded"
    Then Close the pipeline logs
    Then Validate OUT record count is equal to IN record count
    Then Validate that file gets successfully deleted from the gcs bucket
    Then Validate output file generated by xmlReader and file sink plugin "fileSinkTargetBucket" is equal to expected output file "outputForXMLTest"

  @XMLREADER_TEST @FILE_SINK_TEST
  Scenario: To verify data is getting transferred from XmlReader to File sink using move action
    Given Open Datafusion Project to configure pipeline
    When Select plugin: "XML Reader" from the plugins list as: "Source"
    When Expand Plugin group in the LHS plugins list: "Sink"
    When Select plugin: "File" from the plugins list as: "Sink"
    Then Connect plugins: "XMLReader" and "File" to establish connection
    Then Navigate to the properties page of plugin: "XMLReader"
    Then Enter input plugin property: "referenceName" with value: "ReferenceName"
    Then Enter input plugin property: "path" with value: "xmlTestFile"
    Then Enter input plugin property: "nodePath" with value: "node"
    Then Select dropdown plugin property: "reprocessingRequired" with option value: "No"
    Then Select dropdown plugin property: "ActionAfterProcessingFile" with option value: "Move"
    Then Enter input plugin property: "targetFolder" with value: "folder"
    Then Validate "XMLReader" plugin properties
    Then Close the Plugin Properties page
    Then Navigate to the properties page of plugin: "File"
    Then Enter input plugin property: "referenceName" with value: "FileReferenceName"
    Then Enter input plugin property: "path" with value: "fileSinkTargetBucket"
    Then Replace input plugin property: "pathSuffix" with value: "yyyy-MM-dd-HH-mm"

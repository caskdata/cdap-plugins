Introduction
============

A Hydrator Real Time Plugin that allows data to be fetched from a given URL at a specified interval.

Getting Started
===============

Prerequisites
-------------

To use this plugin, you must have CDAP version 3.4.0 or later.

Build
-----
To build your plugins::

  mvn clean package -DskipTests

The build will create a .jar and .json file under the ``target`` directory.
These files can be used to deploy your plugins.

UI Integration
--------------
The Cask Hydrator UI displays each plugin property as a simple textbox. To customize how the plugin properties
are displayed in the UI, you can place a configuration file in the ``widgets`` directory.
The file must be named following a convention of ``[plugin-name]-[plugin-type].json``.
See [Plugin Widget Configuration](http://docs.cdap.io/cdap/current/en/cdap-apps/hydrator/custom.html#plugin-configuration-json)
for details on the configuration file.
The UI will also display a reference doc for your plugin if you place a file in the ``docs`` directory
that follows the convention of ``[plugin-name]-[plugin-type].md``.

When the build runs, it will scan the ``widgets`` and ``docs`` directories in order to build an appropriately
formatted .json file under the ``target`` directory. This file is deployed along with your .jar file to add your
plugins to CDAP.

Deployment
----------
You can deploy your plugins using the CDAP CLI::

  > load artifact <target/plugin.jar> config-file <target/plugin.json>

For example, if your artifact is named 'my-plugins-1.0.0'::

  > load artifact target/my-plugins-1.0.0.jar config-file target/my-plugins-1.0.0.json

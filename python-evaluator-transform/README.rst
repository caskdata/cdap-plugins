=================================
Transformations: Python Evaluator
=================================

Plugin to use Python code to write an ETL Transform.

Introduction
-----------
Executes user-provided Python code that transforms one record into another.
Input records are converted into Python dictionaries which can be directly accessed
in Python code. "Python" in this context is `Jython <http://www.jython.org>`__, a Java-implementation of Python.
The transform expects to receive a JSON object as input, which it will
convert back to a record in Java to pass to downstream transforms and sinks.

Use Case
--------
The Python Evaluator transform is used when other transforms cannot meet your needs.
For example, you may want to multiply a field by 1024 and rename it from ``'gigabytes'``
to ``'megabytes'``. Or you might want to convert a timestamp into a human-readable date string.

Getting Started
===============

Following are instructions to build and deploy hydrator transform plugins.

Prerequisites
-------------
To use plugins, you must have CDAP version 3.2.0 or later. 
You can download the CDAP Standalone SDK that includes Hydrator `here <http://cask.co/downloads>`__.

Build Plugin
------------
You can get started with the Hydrator plugin by building directly from the latest source code::

  git clone https://github.com/caskdata/hydrator-plugins.git
  cd hydrator-plugins
  mvn clean package -pl python-evaluator-transform

You can build without running tests by using::

  mvn clean package -DskipTests -pl python-evaluator-transform

After the build completes, you will have a JAR for the plugin under the
``python-evaluator-transform/target/`` directory.

Deploy Plugin
-------------
You can deploy the transform plugin using the CDAP CLI::

  cdap > load artifact python-evaluator-transform/target/python-evaluator-transform-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
         config-file python-evaluator-transform/resources/plugin/python-evaluator-transform.json

Copy the UI configuration to the CDAP installation::

  $ cp python-evaluator-transform/resources/ui/PythonEvaluator.json $CDAP_HOME/ui/templates/common/

Plugin Description
==================

PythonEvaluatorTransform
------------------------

:Id:
    **PythonEvaluatorTransform**
:Type:
    Transform
:Mode:
    Batch and
    Realtime
:Description:
    Executes user-provided Python code that transforms one record into another.
:Configuration:
    **script:** Python code defining how to transform one record into another. The script must
    implement a function called ``'transform'``, which takes as input a Python dictionary (representing
    the input record), an emitter object, and a context object (which contains CDAP metrics and logger).
    The script can then use the emitter object to emit transformed Python dictionaries.

    For example:

    ``'def transform(record, emitter, context): record['count'] *= 1024; emitter.emit(record)'``

    will scale the ``'count'`` field of ``record`` by 1024.

    **schema:** The schema of output objects. If no schema is given, it is assumed that the output
    schema is the same as the input schema.

Example
-------
::

  {
    "name": "PythonEvaluator",
    "properties": {
      "script": "def transform(record, emitter, context):
                     tax = record['subtotal'] * 0.0975
                     if (tax > 1000.0):
                         context.getMetrics().count('tax.above.1000', 1)
                     if (tax < 0.0):
                         context.getLogger().info('Received record with negative subtotal')
                     emitter.emit({
                         'subtotal': record['subtotal'],
                         'tax': tax,
                         'total': record['subtotal'] + tax,
                     })
                ",
      "schema": "{
        \"type\":\"record\",
        \"name\":\"expanded\",
        \"fields\":[
          {\"name\":\"subtotal\",\"type\":\"double\"},
          {\"name\":\"tax\",\"type\":\"double\"},
          {\"name\":\"total\",\"type\":\"double\"}
        ]
      }"
    }
  }

The transform takes records that have a ``'subtotal'`` field, calculates ``'tax'`` and
``'total'`` fields based on the subtotal, and then returns a record, as a Python dictionary,
containing those three fields.


Known Issues
============
The PythonEvaluator transform has a memory leak which affects the CDAP SDK. 
Running it multiple times from within the same JVM in the CDAP SDK will result in an 
OutOfMemoryError: PermGen Space (https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-4222).

=========================================

Introduction
============

This project is a collection of MongoDB source and sink plugins. Following is list of plugins that are currently available:

- MongoDB Batch Source,
- MongoDB Batch Sink,
- MongoDB RealtimeSink

Getting Started
===============

Following are instructions to build and deploy hydrator MongoDB plugins.

Prerequisites
-------------

To use plugins, you must have CDAP version 3.2.0 or later. You can download CDAP Standalone that includes Hydrator `here <http://cask.co/downloads>`__

Build Plugins
-------------

You can get started with Hydrator plugins by building directly from the latest source code::

  git clone https://github.com/caskdata/hydrator-plugins.git
  cd hydrator-plugins
  mvn clean package -pl mongodb-plugins

After the build completes, you will have a jar for each plugin under the
``mongodb-plugins/target/`` directory.

Deploy Plugins
--------------

You can deploy transform plugins using the CDAP CLI::

  > load artifact target/mongodb-plugins-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT-batch.jar \
         config-file resources/plugin/mongodb-batch-plugins.json

  > load artifact target/mongodb-plugins-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT-realtime.jar \
         config-file resources/plugin/mongodb-realtime-plugins.json

Copy the UI configuration to CDAP installation::

  > cp mongodb-plugins/resources/ui/*.json $CDAP_HOME/ui/templates/common/

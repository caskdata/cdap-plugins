# DecisionTreeTrainer


Description
-----------
Trains a regression model based upon a particular label and features of a record. Saves this model to a FileSet.

Use Case
--------
This sink can be used when you have a sample data and you want to use it, to build a Decision Tree Regression model.
This model can be used further for predicting the label.

Properties
----------
**fileSetName:** The name of the FileSet to save the model to.

**path:** Path of the FileSet to save the model to.

**features:** A comma-separated sequence of fields to use for training. Features to be used, must be of simple type :
String, int, double, float, long, bytes, boolean.

**predictionField:** The field from which to get the prediction. It must be of type double.

**maxDepth:** Maximum depth of the tree.
              For example, depth 0 means 1 leaf node; depth 1 means 1 internal node + 2 leaf nodes. Default is 10.

**maxBins:** Maximum number of bins used for splitting when discretizing continuous features. DecisionTree requires
maxBins to be at least as large as the number of values in each categorical feature. Default is 100.


Example
-------
This example uses the fields ``dofM, dofW, scheduleDepTime, scheduledArrTime, carrier, elapsedTime, origin, dest`` from
the input record as features and ``delayed`` field as the label to train the model.
